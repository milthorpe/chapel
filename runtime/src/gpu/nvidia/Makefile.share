# 1. our bundled clang (15 as of today) doesn't support warp-reductions which
# came in with 8.x. So, we are limiting our runtime binary to 7.5. This seems to
# work fine even if the user code is compiled with >7.5.
# 2. clang-14 wants offload-arch to be passed multiple times and doesn't accept
# a comma-separated list.
