bug: `dsiAccess` method of BlockDist causes misaligned access in CUDA 12
#24429

The issue probably has something to do with struct padding (likely involving
`myLocArr.locDom`). It is reproducible in CUDA 12 but not in 11. I don't know
what to make of it, but either some stricter checking or some sort of memory
mapping/randomization heuristic new in CUDA 12 exposing it.

I tested both CUDA 11.8 and 12 with bundled LLVM 17. While there's something
LLVM can help with us here, I don't think LLVM version is the source of the
problem.

Because this code currently has different behaviors based on CUDA versions, I am
not adding a bad file.
