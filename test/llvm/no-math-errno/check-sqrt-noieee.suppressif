# suppress failures to this test on chapcs

# For some reason, the chapcs system is generating a call to the standard
# library for this test. But this does not happen on newer systems.
# Additionally, it does not seem to happen when compiling C code.
# Adding --ccflags -fno-math-errno has no effect.
# It is very curious that the code emitted with --no-ieee-float / -ffast-math
# appears to be worse than the code emitted with --ieee-float / -fno-fast-math.
#
# For now, just suppressif that system to quiet testing.
